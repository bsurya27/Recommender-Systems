## 🎯 How to Trigger Recommendations

### **🔥 FORCE COMMAND** (Best for immediate results!)
- **"RECOMMEND NOW"** - Gets instant recommendations using ALL info you've shared

- "What do you recommend?"
- "Show me some options"
- "Give me recommendations" 
- "What should I watch?"
- "I'm ready for suggestions"

### **Conversational Triggers**
- "Based on what I told you, what do you think?"
- "Any ideas for me?"
- "What matches my preferences?"
- "I think you have enough info now"

### **Natural Flow**
The agent will offer recommendations automatically after you share 2-3 preferences!
